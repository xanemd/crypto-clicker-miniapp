     ```

5. **Deploy the project:**

   - Extract all directories from the "code" folder in the UI KIT archive into the "core" directory of your project.

7. **Set Up CRON Jobs:**

   To ensure the application runs smoothly and its background tasks are executed timely, you need to set up the following CRON jobs:

   - **Autopilot Script** (`/cron/autopilot.php`):
     - **Frequency**: Every hour
     - **CRON Expression**:
       ```bash
       0 * * * * /usr/bin/php /path/to/your/project/cron/autopilot.php
       ```

   - **Avatar Update Script** (`/cron/avatar.php`):
     - **Frequency**: Every minute
     - **CRON Expression**:
       ```bash
       * * * * * /usr/bin/php /path/to/your/project/cron/avatar.php
       ```

   - **Daily Script** (`/cron/index.php`):
     - **Frequency**: At midnight every day
     - **CRON Expression**:
       ```bash
       0 0 * * * /usr/bin/php /path/to/your/project/cron/index.php
       ```

   **Steps to Set Up CRON Jobs:**

   1. Open your CRON job configuration file:
      ```bash
      crontab -e
      ```

   2. Add the above CRON expressions to the file, replacing `/path/to/your/project` with the actual path to your project directory.

   3. Save and exit the editor.

   These CRON jobs will now execute the specified scripts at their respective intervals.
